    <h1>How to Sign Up</h1>
    <h2>Serving your volleyball needs since 1979</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Industrial Volleyball League, Inc. organizes indoor volleyball competition in the southern San Francisco peninsula and San Jose area. We offer five levels of play in the coed, ranging from recreational play to open competition. There are four levels in the reverse coed, four in the women's and three in the men's (when offered). For more information on the levels, go to League Format.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Our seasons run approximately eight to nine weeks with playoffs. Each league meets once per week and usually consists of six or nine teams (depending upon the number of courts at their facility). Each night, three teams play a 6 game round-robin on one court (team A x team B, team A x team C, team B x team C).</p>
    <br />
    <p>While two teams play, the third team officiates. Each team is required to provide a referee, an umpire and two line judges. Referees are certified by taking a written test prior to their first experience as officials. The IVL provides paid referees and umpires during the playoffs.</p>
